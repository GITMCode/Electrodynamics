This is a library of codes that allows running different models of the high latitude ionospheric electrodynamics.


Available auroral models:
- Feature Tracking of the Auroral (FTA): Requires AU and AL indices
- Fuller Rowell and Evans [1986]: Requires hemispheric power, which can be derived using the AE index.
- OVATION-Prime: Requires IMF and solar wind.
- OVATION-SME: Requires AE.

Available electric potential models:
- Weimer: Requires IMF and solar wind.
- Heppner-Maynard: Requires IMF and Kp.

Available file formats:
- Binary file from AMIE files.
